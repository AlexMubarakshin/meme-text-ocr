# meme-text-ocr
Applies Tesseract Optical Character Recognition on an image of text taken from a meme.

### Motivation:

In a [previous project](https://github.com/evmarts/twitter-screencap-cropper), memes were partitioned into a text component and an image component: 

<img src="./figures/fig1.jpg" width="256px" alt="">

We may want to convert the text component into a string so that we can reuse, modify or analyze it. The meme-text-ocr.py script recognizes the text in an image of text:

### meme-text-ocr.py

Prompts user for an image of text:

~~~
$ python meme-text-ocr.py
Image of text to recognize: in/text.jpg
~~~

<img src="./figures/fig2.jpg" width="512px" alt=""> text.jpg

Outputs the following

~~~
Text recognized as: 'When you call shotgun but end up in the back'
